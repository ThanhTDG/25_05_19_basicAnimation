Properties: 
* Premultiply Alpha: When enabled, the RGB values will multiplied by the alpha channel. 
Non-Premultiplied Alpha: The GPU calculates
result = source.RGB * source.A + dest.RGB * (1 - source.A), 
which needs more multiplications per pixel. Because RGB is not multiplied by alpha before, blending can cause color errors, especially on transparent edges.Premultiplied Alpha:
RGB is already multiplied by alpha. The GPU calculates
result = source.RGB + dest.RGB * (1 - source.A),
using fewer operations, making rendering faster. Also, blending and interpolation are more accurate, avoiding color halos.
* Wrap Mode:
Clamp Mode:
Restricts texture coordinates (UV) to the range [0, 1], and extends the edge pixels when coordinates exceed that range.
Repeat Mode:
Repeats the texture content within the [0, 1] range multiple times when coordinates go beyond the limits.
* Texture Filter Modes:
Point Filtering: Uses the closest texel color. Fast but causes blocky or aliased textures.
Bilinear Filtering: Blends colors of 4 nearest texels, smoothing blockiness. More computation than Point.
Trilinear Filtering: Blends bilinear results from 2 mipmap levels for smoothest textures. Most computationally heavy.
